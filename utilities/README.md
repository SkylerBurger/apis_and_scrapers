# Chromedriver Info

The `chromedriver` is needed so `selenium` can start up an instance of the Chrome browser to control during our web scraping requests. Each `chromedriver` supports a single version of Google Chrome so you will need to replace this file frequently. New versions can be located on the [Chromium ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) page.
